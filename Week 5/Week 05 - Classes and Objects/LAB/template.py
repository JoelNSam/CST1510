# ====================================================================== CLASS
# 1. Define a class called Record.
#
class Record:
    def __init__(self, label, value, limit):
        self.label = label
        self.value = value
        self.limit = limit
#    Typical   : add a method status(self) that returns "OVER LIMIT" (100%+),
#                "WARNING" (90%+) or "OK", worked out from self.value and
#                self.limit. Give it a one-line docstring.
#    Excellent : also add over_limit_count as a class-level running total -
#                see the note below.

# your class goes here


# ==================================================================== RECORDS
# 2. Create your records.
#
r1 = Record("R-001", 87, 100)
r2 = Record("R-002", 120, 100)
#    Typical   : same, but now print each one's .status() as well.
#    Excellent : instead, write load_records(path) that reads label,value,limit
#                lines from a file and returns a list of Record objects. Make
#                your own data file, one record per line.

records = [r1, r2]


# ==================================================================== OUTPUT
# 3. Print a report for each record.
#
#    Threshold : label, value, limit, inside a border.
#    Typical   : add the result of .status().
#    Excellent : also keep a running count of how many came back OVER LIMIT
#                across every record, and print that once, after the loop.
#                (Simplest: a plain variable outside the loop, same pattern
#                as Week 4. If you want it to live ON the object instead,
#                that is a stretch worth trying - but a variable is enough.)

for record in records:
    print()
    print("=" * 34)
    print(f"  RECORD CHECK  -  {record.label}")
    print("=" * 34)

    print(f"  Label: {record.label}")
    print(f"  Value: {record.value}")
    print(f"  Limit: {record.limit}")

    print("=" * 34)


# ==========================================================================
# 4. Before you finish:
#
#    [ ] Run it and check every record's numbers by hand
#    [ ] Check every method only reads/changes its OWN object (self) -
#        nothing reaches outside itself
#    [ ] Check every method and __init__ has a one-line docstring
